# Initial Spec Idea: Instructionalization & Tagging

**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Source:** Product Roadmap Item 5

## User's Description

Convert raw text into chat-format JSONL with system/user/assistant roles, apply persona tags (twain/franklin/neutral), tone tags (humorous/satirical/didactic), domain tags (weather/general), and create balanced train/validation splits (90/10).

## Context

This is the 5th item in the product roadmap, following the completion of:
1. Environment Setup & Data Infrastructure
2. Literary Corpus Collection
3. Reddit Humor Dataset Processing
4. Data Normalization & Deduplication Pipeline

The normalized and deduplicated dataset is now ready to be converted into the final training format with proper instructionalization and tagging.
